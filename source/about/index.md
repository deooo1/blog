I'm a 28 year old programmer from Sofia, Bulgaria. 
In this blog I store my rants from things that I feel good about or not so much.
You can find more information about me in the `profile` links and things I've worked on or am involved with are accessable from the `projects` link. 

I've used a this great [cactus theme](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) on this made with [hexo](https://hexo.io) blog.
