At the end of the 2018 a friend of mine called to tell me about an entrepreneurial program.
He pitched it very well. I didn’t know what it was actually about (still don’t), but I knew that I was going to apply.

## The journey

The first module of the [ABLE activator](https://activator.bg/) program was a 3 day getaway starting from February the 15th in the morning.
The day came and at 9:30 I was present at the railway station. And saw many people with unfamiliar faces. We weren’t told where we were going. Questions were asked, answers were missing. One thing was certain, we we’re going to travel by train.
In the train we played a game. Each person asked questions to everyone in his/hers cabin in order to get to know them better and to win some matchsticks (a competitive rule in the game). People changed cabins, everybody was talking and sharing their deepest thoughts on many existential questions. After an hour an a half we arrived at our destination. All those unfamiliar faces were gone. There were only people that you were quite familiar with. People who you knew for at least two months.
Our stop was the town of Kostenets. It’s the type of place that you frequently pass by, but rarely stop there.
So we went to our hotel, checked in and with no time to lose started doing activities in which we would have fun, work together and learn something at the same time. I’ll keep it short because it was quite the action packed weekend.

## The activities

### Breath in

We were bursting each others bubbles (literally), guiding each other in our dream walks, defusing bombs (and destroying cities in the process), making gas lamps,
climbing trees, starting fires by a chemical reaction, leading a human managed conveyor operation, creating a pipeline.
And after each game we discussed it, who knew it was more than just a game it was a lesson. Lessons were learned about leadership, cooperation, empowerment, power of now and much more.
Had lectures by 2 very thriving individuals who gave us knowledge that they attained through arguably the most valuable thing – time.
At the end of every day, we gathered in a circle and everyone was presented with the opportunity to say what he/she liked or learned today.
And did a yoga like final relaxation while reflecting on the passed day.

### Breath out

Strangers came in, Friends came out.
example
It was a wonderful experience in which we learned a lot, met new people, had fun and kept social media to the minimum.
Special thanks to all people that made this event possible. Looking forward for the rest of the program.

### TL;DR

The people at ABLE are amazing; Be part of communities that share your interests; Be persistent in order to achieve and have fun doing it.
